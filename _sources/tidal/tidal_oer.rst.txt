Introduction
============

Renewable energy from the oceans can be produced in many ways. Examples include offshore wind, tidal stream, ocean current, tidal range, wave, thermal, salinity gradients, and biomass sources :cite:`Borthwick2016`. There is scope for all of these to play a role in delivering a sustainable, low-carbon future.

In this Open Educational Resource (OER), we focus on the energy contained in the tides. Tides are very long-period waves that move through the oceans in response to the forces exerted by the moon and sun (i.e. the *Earth-Moon-Sun system*).

The propagation of tides around  coastal sites often leads to predictable high magnitude velocities and sea level elevation variations. The occurrence of the  **amplified streams** (high velocity currents) or **ranges** (large elevation differences) is a result of the interaction amongst localised physical characteristics, such as the coastline or bathymetry profile, and the hydrodynamics induced by the propagation of the tidal waves.  


As an example, a first array of tidal stream turbines has been installed in the Pentland Firth, Scotland, UK. The Pentland Firth is a prime example of a site that offers high velocity tidal currents that justify the deployment of marine hydrokinetic devices. 

Interest in tidal range structures has also resurfaced following the construction of the Lake Sihwa tidal power station in South Korea, while promising  sites in the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary have been identified for their potential :cite:`Hendry2017`.
